This folder contains the KiCad project of the midi@3:14 keyboard PCB.

Issues
======

* The PCB has no mounting holes. They must be drilled manually.
* Potentiometers have been rotated by 180 degrees from their standard orientation.
  Bourns PTV09A potentiometers have a D-shaped shaft: you can use blank knobs, or knobs with a round hole and a set-screw.
* The spacing between potentiometers is too short.
  The knob diameter must be less than 19 mm.
